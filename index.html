          <h1>About</h1>
        <p> My journey to tech started out of stark curiosity. The thrill in problem solving really excites me and I love to to code Data Structures and Algorithms in java.
          My development journey kickstarted with Android Dev (You can check out my work in the Projects section below) and currently exploring the vast world of Web dev.
          <br>The one thing I love about being in tech is that it always keeps me on my feet as a learner (Give a check on my certifications) and the endeless posibilities out there.
          Feel free to leave a message for suggestions,collaborations and advices
